## Hi, It's Bartu (aka bafti) ðŸ‘¾

I am ***Computer Engineering*** student at Ã‡ankaya University. My main interest lies in embedded programming. In the past, I have worked with STM32 microcontrollers using ***stm32duino*** and ***STM32 HAL*** libraries.

I am also passionate about rocketry and am currently serving as the software team lead at a rocketry team called **[BeeRocketry](https://beerocketry.com)**. Furthermore, I want to dive into STM32 HAL and MATLAB Simulink for rocketry.

- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently a second-year student.
- ðŸ–¥ Iâ€™m currently learning MATLAB Simulink and coding STM32's with HAL library.
- ðŸš€ I'm currently part of the BeeRocketry Team.
